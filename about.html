         <h2> Overview </h2>

         <p>
            Xiao Huang, or <i>Little Yellow</i> in Chinese (he is <i>not</i> little), is a 10-year-old cat that is <b>full of personality and quirks.</b> 
            He will follow everyone around the house, shove his face into our dirty feet to mark his scent, and persistently paw us for food when we eat.
            This would make you think that he just loves being around the family and that he is very affectionate, which is true, 
            <str>but there are hidden sides to this.</str>
            There are times he would chase an invisible entity, stare intensely at nothing in the corner, <b>then attack you.</b> It's all in good fun though, and in this blog, we will explore his various <i>quirky</i> sides. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Let's delve a little bit into the mind of Xiao Huang. 
            There seems to be some sort of <b>hierarchy</b> to him in which he obeys.
         </p>
         <table>
            <thead>
               <tr>
                  <th scope="col">Person</th>
                  <th></th>
                  <th scope="col">Name</th>
               </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
               <tr>
                  <td colspan="2">Mom</td>
                  <td colspan="2">1</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td colspan="2">Dad</td>
                  <td colspan="2">2</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                  <td colspan="2">Me</td>
                  <td colspan="2">???</td>
               </tr>
            </tbody>
         </table>
         <p>
            When my mom is around, he will <i>only</i> answer to her. When it is only me and my dad around, it is a 50/50.
            It is not confirmed, but it seems like the amount of <b>treats</b> we give him has an influence on this.
            Xiao Huang also seems to believe that everything in this house (possibly including even us) is his. 
            He will lie down wherever, use everything he can find as a scratching post, and ensure that his fur is spread everywhere.
            Of course, everything is speculation, and <b>no one can truly understand what is going on in that head of his.</b>
         </p>
