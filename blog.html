      <h2>Sleepy Huang</h2>
      <p>
        When Xiao Huang is sleepy (which is almost all the time), he tends to sleep in different areas and in different positions.
        Sometimes he looks like a <b>superhero</b> with his arms outstretched, and other times he looks like a <b>fried chicken</b> when he is all scrunched up.
        There is <em>rarely</em> an obstacle to a sleeping surface, and he makes it his goal to push the boundaries of it. 
        If we're not careful, we could find him sleeping on the TV counter or even on top of the car.
